practice-xml ReadMe
1. I think that XML relates to HTML in how the tags that are used are pretty self explanitory, most tags in HTML give a pretty fair example of what kind of content is within it. The same goes for XML because you can create your own tags that decribe whatever you want.
2. I think some benefits of HTML using XML syntax would be that there could be more diversity in your tags and content within them, as well as keeping things a bit more organized.
3. Some disadvatages could be that the tags arent auto filled and you have to type the closing tag the whole way. It could have just been this way for me but i found it a bit annoying that i had to type out the enitre tag every time.
